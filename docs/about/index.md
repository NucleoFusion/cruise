# About

Cruise is a powerful, intuitive, and fully-featured TUI (Terminal User Interface) for managing containers. Built with Go and Bubbletea, it offers a visually rich, keyboard-first experience for managing containers, images, volumes, networks, logs and more — all from your terminal.

## Why not CLI?

Ever felt that CLI's for containerization tools are too lengthy or limited? Find yourself executing commands again and again for simple things? Wrote multiline commands just for a typo to ruin it? Well... Fret no more. Cruise - Is a TUI Container Management Client, fitting easily in your terminal-first dev workflow, while making repetitive work easy and interactive.

    How is cruise different from existing solutions?

Existing applications are limited in what they do, they serve as mostly a monitoring service, not a management service let alone a Client.

## Why not other TUI Alternatives?

Other TUI Alternatives such as lazydocker or docui (deprecated) are more of a _monitoring_ service than a _management_ application.

Cruise on the other hand, aims to be a Container Management TUI, allowing management _and_ monitoring of most services. With cruise
you can have the benefits of a TUI app without having to deal with the downsides of the CLI. It blends both of them perfectly
obtaining the best of both worlds.

Oh, and did I mention? Cruise looks a lot better... _and is also configurable_.
