# Security Policy

Thank you for helping keep Cruise secure!

## Reporting Vulnerabilities

If you discover a security issue, please report it by contacting the mentors or by opening a private GitHub Security Advisory. When reporting, please include:

- A description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce (if possible)
- Impact and potential risk

We aim to respond within 5 business days and will work with you to investigate, address, and disclose the issue responsibly.

Please do **not** file security issues publicly (as GitHub Issues or Discussions) to prevent unnecessary risk to users.

Your report will be kept confidential until a patch is released.

## Public Disclosure

After a fix is implemented, we will announce the resolution in the release notes.

Thank you for contributing to a safer open source ecosystem!
